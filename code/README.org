#+TITLE: Code

This folder contains code published with the original paper as well as new code to reproduce and investigate some of the results.

The original code is the =RemoteCollaboration_CodeMainFigures.ipynb= notebook that comes from [[https://lyl010.github.io/page5.html][the author's website]].
The file in this repository is the same as the original, except with a few code comments added in for clarity.

For the code in each of the =YYYY-MM-DD_*/= folders, navigate into those folders and execute the =Snakefile= to recreate the output files in the [[../results/][=results/=]] folder.
For example:

#+BEGIN_SRC shell
cd 2023-11-29_dscore-dist/
snakemake -j 1
#+END_SRC
