#+TITLE: Example distributions

This folder contains code to plot some explanatory plots for what is likely happening in this paper.
The first plots a causal graph of the variables discussed in this paper and their causal relationships to each other.
The second simulates fake data to demonstrate [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berkson%27s_paradox][Berkson's paradox]] with artificial athletics and academic "scores" that are intentiionally independent of each other.

For details about causal graphs, how to build them, and how to use them, please see the following textbooks:
